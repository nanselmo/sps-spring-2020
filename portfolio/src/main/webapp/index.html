        <h3>Middle School Robotics Team (Past)</h3>
        <img src="/images/regional-tourney.jpg">
        <p> Prior to joining Google, I was a developer at Cesar Chavez Elementary School. I started a Code Club and Robotics Team. In our first year, we were the only Chicago Public School team to make it to the state and then national competition. Check us out on Chicago's local news station <a href="https://wgntv.com/2017/05/08/midday-fix-vex-world-robotics-championship-competitors-jose-lemus-and-gabriel-parra/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Weasley Clock (Future)</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2017/01/FO9GSWBIXGFORAL.LARGE_.jpg">
        <p>I don't make time to tinker as much as I should, but I would love for my next project to be this Weasley Clock. I would use Google Maps to determine my location (and my partner's) and ping that to an Arduino which would use servo motors to update a clock. There are some instructions on the web including <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-Your-Own-Weasley-Location-Clock/">these</a> from Instructables and <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/16/build-your-own-functional-weasley-clock-with-iot-location-tracker-arduinomonday/">these</a> from Adafruit. </p>
